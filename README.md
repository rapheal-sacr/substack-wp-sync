## How It Works

### Automated Synchronization Process
1. **Scheduled Sync:** WordPress cron runs hourly to check for new content
2. **Feed Processing:** Fetches and parses Substack RSS feed using WordPress core functions
3. **GUID Tracking:** Compares Substack post GUIDs against database to identify new/updated content
4. **Batch Processing:** Processes posts individually with real-time progress tracking
5. **Content Import:** Creates new WordPress posts or updates existing ones based on GUID matching
6. **Media Handling:** Downloads images via `media_sideload_image()` and sets featured images automatically
7. **Content Processing:** Removes Substack-specific elements (subscription boxes, like buttons) and adds custom subscription links
8. **Category Assignment:** Applies keyword-based category mapping if configured
9. **Error Handling:** Logs failures with detailed error messages and retry tracking
10. **Statistics Update:** Updates sync statistics and activity logs

### Manual Sync Process
1. **AJAX-Powered Interface:** Real-time progress tracking with post-by-post status updates
2. **Progressive Processing:** Handles large feeds without timeout issues using batch processing
3. **Visual Feedback:** Progress bars, counters, and color-coded status indicators
4. **Error Recovery:** Retry failed posts with reset retry counts
5. **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed activity log with timestamps and status codes

### Rollback & Management
1. **Flexible Rollback:** Remove all posts, failed posts only, or posts within date ranges
2. **Safe Deletion:** Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss
3. **Database Cleanup:** Removes both WordPress posts and sync log entries
4. **Audit Trail:** Maintains detailed logs of all rollback operations

## Database Schema

The plugin creates a custom table `wp_substack_sync_log` with the following structure:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INT AUTO_INCREMENT | Primary key |
| `post_id` | INT | WordPress post ID (0 for failed imports) |
| `substack_guid` | VARCHAR(255) | Unique Substack post identifier |
| `substack_title` | TEXT | Post title for reference and error reporting |
| `sync_date` | DATETIME | Initial sync timestamp |
| `last_modified` | DATETIME | Last update timestamp |
| `status` | VARCHAR(20) | Sync status: 'imported', 'updated', 'error' |
| `retry_count` | INT | Number of retry attempts (max 3) |
| `error_message` | TEXT | Detailed error information for troubleshooting |

**Indexes:**
- Primary key on `id`
- Unique index on `substack_guid`
- Index on `status` for efficient filtering
- Index on `sync_date` for chronological queries

- Comments section becoming a portal to a dimension where everyone speaks only in haikus
- Plugin achieving enlightenment and abandoning materialism to become a Buddhist monk

**Do not use Substack Sync™ if you:**
- Are allergic to automation, databases, or success
- Have a history of taking software disclaimers too literally
- Are currently operating heavy machinery while managing a WordPress site
- Believe that plugins can achieve sentience (they totally can't, we promise)

- Gravitational anomalies in your server rack
- Cat videos to spontaneously appear in your business blog

- Your backup strategy to achieve enlightenment before you do

**Substack Sync™ is not recommended for:**
- Mission-critical applications (like blogs about your pet goldfish)
- Users who believe warranties exist in the realm of free WordPress plugins
- People who think "it works on my machine" is a valid support strategy
- Anyone expecting actual human support from software that costs $0.00

**Remember:** If your website starts displaying content in languages you don't recognize, begins communicating with satellites, or develops the ability to order pizza without your permission, discontinue use immediately and consult your local IT exorcist.

*Substack Sync™ is not approved for use by the FDA, FCC, FBI, or any other three-letter agencies. Not tested on animals, but several houseplants reported improved growth rates during development.*

**This plugin is provided "as-is" with absolutely no warranty, support, or guarantee that it won't achieve consciousness and run off to join the circus. The author is not responsible for any damages, real or imaginary, including but not limited to: data loss, existential crisis, spontaneous combustion of servers, or the plugin developing strong opinions about your content strategy.**

*Use at your own risk. Seriously. We're not kidding about this part.*

---

**Substack Sync™** - *Because someone has to sync that content, and it might as well be software that could theoretically become sentient and judge your life choices.*

*Available now at absolutely no cost, which should tell you everything you need to know about the level of support you can expect.*
